# file structure

Basically I just make the files to 3 parts

- a function js
- a interface js
- a test file for the functions

# future to do:

- the node interface is so dummy, like a bot, need to make it more friendly able to extra from user's input
- make a simple ui by using React, and if possible to have a fake login
